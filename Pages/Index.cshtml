                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Every single day, in chat rooms and forums across the internet, someone does this:</p>

                <div class="chat-example bad">
                    <div class="message">
                        <span class="user">User:</span> "Can I ask a question?"
                    </div>
                    <div class="message">
                        <span class="user">User:</span> "Anyone around?"
                    </div>
                    <div class="message">
                        <span class="user">User:</span> "Is anyone here who knows about JavaScript?"
                    </div>
                    <div class="waiting">⏳ <em>...waiting...</em></div>

                <p class="explanation">
                    <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You've just wasted everyone's time, including your own. Nobody's going to respond to "Can I ask a question?" because guess what? You already did.

            </section>

            <section class="solution">
                <h2>The Solution (It's Not Rocket Science)</h2>
                <p>Here's a revolutionary concept: just ask your actual question. Wild, I know.</p>

                <div class="chat-example good">
                    <div class="message">
                        <span class="user">User:</span> "I'm trying to fetch data using JavaScript's fetch() API, but I'm getting a CORS error. I've set the mode to 'cors' but it still fails. Has anyone encountered this before?"

            <section class="why">
                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Saves Time:</strong> Shocking revelation - people can start thinking about your problem immediately instead of wondering if you're going to actually ask something.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respects Others:</strong> Not everyone is glued to their screen waiting for you. A complete question means they can help when they see it, not play 20 questions with you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gets Better Answers:</strong> The right expert can jump in, rather than just whoever happened to be online when you decided to be mysterious.</li>
                    <li><strong>Searchable:</strong> Future people with the same problem can actually find your question and the answer. You know, like how the internet is supposed to work.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Permission Needed:</strong> This is a chat channel. For asking questions. You don't need a permission slip from your mom.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                    <p>❌ "Is there a Python expert here?"</p>
                    <p>❌ "Hello?"</p>

                <h2>What to Do Instead</h2>
                <div class="good-examples">
                    <p>✅ "I'm getting error X when I try Y. Here's what I've tried: Z. Any ideas?"</p>
                    <p>✅ "How do I configure Docker to use a custom network? I've looked at the docs but I'm confused about..."</p>
                    <p>✅ "My Python script crashes with 'IndexError: list index out of range' at line 42. Here's the relevant code: [code snippet]"</p>
